Program these :

> Play a land

> Cast a spell

> Each battle damage corresponds to 1 byte from the input (tapping the lands?) being
outputted

> Declare attacker

> Memnite [memnite] : https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194078

> Pass
>> Go to next turn

> Play land, each land colour corresponds to a number between 0-5
[B, G, U, R, W, gen] = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

> I think they should be a "bit" each, but base 6
>> i.e.
>> I tap a swamp, island, and forest = input 534 -> 180+9+4 -> 193

> Each turn can only play 1 land (duh)

*For now we input by tapping land during battle phase*
*Later why don't we change it to be the land that have been tapped this turn*
*idk if life will be implemented or not*
